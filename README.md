# 0G Storage

## Overview

0G Storage is a decentralized data storage system designed to address the challenges of high-throughput and low-latency data storage and retrieval, in areas such as AI and gaming. 

In addition, it forms the storage layer for the 0G data availability (DA) system, with the cross-layer integration abstracted away from Rollup and AppChain builders.

## System Architecture

0G Storage consists of two main components:

1. **Data Publishing Lane**: Ensures quick data availability and verification through the 0G Consensus network.
2. **Data Storage Lane**: Manages large data transfers and storage using an erasure-coding mechanism for redundancy and reliability.

Across the two lanes, 0G Storage supports the following features:

* **General Purpose Design**: Supports atomic transactions, mutable key-value stores, and archive log systems, enabling a wide range of applications with various data types.
* **Incentivized Participation**: Utilizes the PoRA (Proof of Random Access) mining algorithm to incentivize storage network participants.
